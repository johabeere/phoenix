| `install.sh`   | Used to perform initial setup. Creates the virtual environment, installs system packages and installs needed python files. | parses `requirements` to the pip module for installation.     |
| `start.sh`     | Used to start the software.Sources the venv before starting python.                                                        | Calls on `Main.py`                                            |

| `Hardware.py`  | Accesses all physical functions of the electronics board.                                                                  | called upon by `Main.py`                                      |

| `requirements` | autogenerated file that contains all required python packages for the other scripts.                                       | Gets parsed to `pip` via `install.sh`                         |
